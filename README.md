# TrailMix

TrailMix is a trail-finding web application created by a team of 5 developers for a 2-day hackathon. The project was originally completed utilizing JavaScript and jQuery, and then was later rebuilt using ReactJS and Redux.

## Usage

This application was created for hikers to search for trails either near them (determined by Google Geolocation) or a specific location of their choosing.  Your next hike is just a few clicks away. The trails can be sorted by rating, length and difficulty to match your preferences.  Get directions and weather conditions as well, so your trip can be well prepared!
